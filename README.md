# Evaporation

The purpose of this repo is to collect code(s) to compute evaporation/evapotranspiration (eo) using several approaches. Although many packages exists, I believe that is better to code it by yourself (as a way of learning and understanding these complex equations).

By the time, two approaches for reference eo are available:
* FAO56 Penman-Monteith
* Hargreaves-Samani

I expect to add many more (see [Xiang et al. 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378377419315616))
